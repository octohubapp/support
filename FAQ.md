##FAQs

**Q. Is this a native app for OSX?**

A. Yes!

**Q. Why is this only available for OSX 10.10 Yosemite?**

A. Octohub uses some 10.10 exclusive features such as Vibrancy, Storyboards, NSTabViewController etc. Apple doesn't make a good effort to help backport an app to previous OSX versions (unlike Google on Android platform, who releases a compat library for backward compatibility).

**Q. Will it ever support previous OSX versions? At least 10.9?**

A. Short answer: May be. Long answer: Our assumption is that by the time Octohub is ready for everyone to use (i.e. ver 1.0), we'll most likely have OSX 10.11. So, we'll have support for an older version of OSX. Also, right now we're just testing/ verifying the features we want to add to Octohub and only a hand full of beta users are what we are looking for. If enough people demand an OSX 10.9 version, we'll certainly release one.

**Q. How about Windows or Linux version?**

A. No plans right now or in the near future. Windows version is a possibility but certainly not a Linux version. Right now we are just laser focused on OSX version.

**Q. What does this app do better than github.com?**

A. First of all, it allows you to tag repositories. Lack of this feature is why we decided to start this project in the first place. We can't talk about all the details, but by the time 1.0 is out, we'll have a lot more features such as: 

* Integrating Twitter timeline for your favorite developers. This makes it easy to see what they are up to. *(STATUS: Implementing)*
* Auto suggested tags. *(STATUS: Implemented in v0.2)*
* Grouping repositories and developers anyway you want by making lists. This way you can just watch the lists that you are interested in, for an example. *(STATUS: Implementation design phase)* 
* Cloud synching and backup. *(STATUS: Planning phase)*
* Filters for activities/ news feed. *(STATUS: Planning phase)*
* Support for multiple devices. *(STATUS: Planning phase)*
* Multiple accounts/ organizations.  *(STATUS: Undecided)*
* You tell us! Let us know what features you want us to add in the final release. You can do this by using [this online feedback](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/8e6427d1be6e591e851b554c57a77dfc/feedback/new) form or using feedback window from within the app: `Octohub > Send Feedback...`

Lastly, we ourselves are a big fan of Mac client apps and use them a lot (such as Mailbox for emails, TweetDeck for Twitter, [LightPaper for Markdown](http://www.ashokgelal.com/lightpaper-for-mac/) etc. Why not one for GitHub, right?

**Q. Is this a replacement for the official GitHub app?**

A. Not at all. They both do different jobs. For one thing, Octohub is more inclined towards the "social aspects" of GitHub than actually managing/cloning/forking repositories. Octohub should complement GitHub and not replace it.

**Q. Will this be a paid app?**

A. Yes!

**Q. Will this be open source?**

A. No.

**Q. Will this be available on the Mac App Store?**

A. We'd love to but we don't know yet. We'll see how everything pans out.

**Q. Why beta signups? Why not just release it for everybody?**

A. Because our infrastructure is not ready yet for everyone. We'd like to add more features and work on a solid plan for a proper distribution channel. There is still a long way to go. However, this doesn't mean Octohub is unstable as of now. Also, we'll only be giving out beta invites to limited users. After that number has reached, we'll stop allowing downloads and distributing beta codes. After that only beta users will be able to use this app. Also, we'll be rewarding our beta users when ver 1.0 comes out. Reward is only valuable when it is exclusive. If everyone can have it, why do you want it? Right?

**Q. When will this be released?**

A. Whenever we feel it is ready with all the important features and stability we've planned for ver 1. We cannot give you an ETA but our target is to release it by mid 2015.

**Q. Will beta users get this app for free when it becomes a paid app?**

A. We'll definitely find out a way to reward you when it becomes a paid app.

**Q. Why is this FAQ on GitHub?**

A. Because we love GitHub. Because you can ask more questions by opening issue tickets. Because git can keep the history of this FAQ (and our words) and you can count us on our promises.

**Q. ~~Star Wars or Star Trek?~~ Swift or Objective-C?**

A. Octohub is (re)written using Swift (we started with Objective-C and switched to Swift about 20% into it). In retrospect, we should not have switched to Swift. It is 100 years ahead of Objective-C but it is not ready yet, tools are not ready yet. So, Objective-C for now and Swift for the future.

**Q. I have more questions. What should I do?**

A. If you feel comfortable asking it in open, you can [create issue tickets](https://github.com/octohubapp/support/issues) or send us a Tweet: <http://twitter.com>. If not, you can always send us an email to `hello@octohubapp.com`
