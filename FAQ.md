##FAQs

**Q. Is this a native app for OSX?**

A. Yes!

**Q. Why is this only available for OSX 10.10 Yosemite?**

A. Octohub uses some 10.10 exclusive features such as Vibrancy, Storyboards, NSTabViewController etc. Apple doesn't make a good effort to help backport an app to previous OSX versions (unlike Google on Android platform, who releases a compat library for backward compatibility).

**Q. Will it ever support previous OSX versions? At least 10.9?**

A. Short answer: May be. Long answer: My assumption is that by the time Octohub is ready for everyone to use (i.e. ver 1.0), we'll most likely have OSX 10.11. That means by then we'll have support for an older version of OSX. Also, right now I'm just testing/ verifying the features I want to add to Octohub and only a hand full of beta users are what I'm looking for. If enough people demand an OSX 10.9 version, I'll certainly release one.

**Q. How about Windows or Linux version?**

A. No plans right now or in the near future. Windows version is a possibility but certainly not a Linux version. Right now I use OSX as my primary OS and I made this app mostly for me.

**Q. What does this app do better than github.com?**

A. First of all, it allows you to tag repositories. Lack of this feature is why I decided to start this project in the first place. I don't want to talk about all the details, but by the time 1.0 is out, I'm planning to add a lot more features such as: 

* Integrating Twitter timeline for your favorite developers. This makes it easy to see what they are up to. *(STATUS: Implementing)*
* Auto suggested tags. *(STATUS: Implemented in v0.2)*
* Grouping repositories and developers anyway you want by making lists. This way you can just watch the lists that you are interested in, for an example. *(STATUS: Planning phase)* 
* Cloud synching and backup. *(STATUS: Undecided)*
* Filters for activities/ news feed. *(STATUS: Implemented in v0.4)*
* Multiple accounts/ organizations.  *(STATUS: Undecided)*
* You tell me! Let me know what features you want to have in the final release. You can do this by using [this online feedback](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/8e6427d1be6e591e851b554c57a77dfc/feedback/new) form or using feedback window from within the app: `Octohub > Send Feedback...`

Lastly, I'm a big fan of Mac client apps and use them a lot (such as Mailbox for emails, TweetDeck for Twitter, [LightPaper for Markdown](http://www.ashokgelal.com/lightpaper-for-mac/) etc. Why not one for GitHub, right?

**Q. Is this a replacement for the official GitHub app?**

A. Not at all. They both do different jobs. For one thing, Octohub is more inclined towards the "social aspects" of GitHub than actually managing/cloning/forking repositories. Octohub should complement GitHub and not replace it.

**Q. Will this be open source?**

A. No.

**Q. Will this be available on the Mac App Store?**

A. Most probably not.

**Q. Why is this FAQ on GitHub?**

A. Because we all love GitHub, don't we? And because you can ask more questions by opening issue tickets.

**Q. ~~Star Wars or Star Trek?~~ Swift or Objective-C?**

A. Octohub is (re)written using Swift (I started with Objective-C and switched to Swift about 20% into it). In retrospect, I should not have switched to Swift. It is 100 years ahead of Objective-C but it is not ready yet, tools are not ready yet. So, Objective-C for now and Swift for the future.

**Q. I have more questions. What should I do?**

A. If you feel comfortable asking it in open, you can [create issue tickets](https://github.com/octohubapp/support/issues) or send me a Tweet: <http://twitter.com/ashokgelal>. If not, you can always send an email to `hello@octohubapp.com`
